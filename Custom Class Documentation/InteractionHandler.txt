Class: InteractionHandler
A class stub for tools that interact with a grid world via a "tap" or "interact" input. Objects can extend from this class and overwrite the default behaviors of on_tap() and on_interact() to define their own behaviors.

Properties:

    display_rect: bool - Flag to indicate whether to display a rectangle.
    rect_coords: Vector2 - Coordinates of the rectangle.

Methods:

set_disp_coords(pos: Vector2) -> void

Sets the display coordinates externally so that the rectangle can be drawn from a global reference point (within this class).

    pos: Vector2 - Display coordinates.

on_tap() -> void

Called when the "tap" behavior is triggered (e.g., left-click). This function is generalized for tools and can be overwritten to define custom behavior.

on_interact() -> void

Called when the "interact" behavior is triggered (e.g., right-click). This function is generalized for tools and can be overwritten to define custom behavior.

Feel free to extend this class and override the on_tap() and on_interact() functions to implement your specific behaviors.
